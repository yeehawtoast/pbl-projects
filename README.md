# pbl-projects
A Home Repo for all of my solutions to the Project Based Learning Repo on Github. Each language will have its own folder, and that languages projects will be nested in there. Each project will include its own separate README.md with instructions for where each project came from, how you can follow along yourself, and how much time you can anticipate spending on each projects. 

# Languages
I use .NET and ABAP as part of my work, so you will not find any c#.net projects here (sorry!), but I will be working with the following 4 language:

1. Dart with Flutter
2. Go
3. Javascript
4. C

I have selected these 3 as they each have different domains they tend to cover. Dart/Flutter is used with mobile apps, Go is a modern backend language, Javascript is everywhere, and C is my personal favorite, but I am out of practice with it. Hopefully you can also find personal growth with these same projects as well!
